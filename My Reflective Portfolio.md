# Week 1-Module 1: Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in the Social World

### Describe in your own words what you've learnt.

Within this module I learned about the notion of systems, complex systems and complex adaptive systems as well as the differences between all of them. I learned about how a system is created when vital relationships are made between the system elements as well as parts. As a result of these relationships a system is able to display characteristics and behaviours.

### Why is it important to learn? How does it connect to what you already know? Was it difficult? Why/why not?

I believe that it is important to learn this as it sets a solid foundation for my knowledge to grow and progress throughout this subject. This connects to what I already know so far nicely as I am able to further my knowledge on how information systems work but through a real life analogy of how systems are involved throughout our day to day life. This module was moderately difficult to learn because of all the content but with perseverance I am confident that I’ll be able to understand this.

### What are some examples of this in action? How can you put your learning into practice?

I believe that I can put my learning into practice by visualising the various types of systems that are involved in day to day life which I will be able to further my understanding of. By doing so I will be more confident with learning the content within this subject and will be able to better visualise various systems before putting them into practice.

### To help you recap on some of the key ideas of this module, consider the following questions.  Include your thoughts in your reflective portfolio:
 
### Is everything a system?  Why or why not?

I believe that everything is part of a system to an extent as everything in the world around us has some sort of relationship that exhibits characteristics that are not found in single elements alone.

### As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?

A passenger aircraft is part of a complex system of airports. I believe that the aircraft would be the relationship between various airports but can also be considered its own complex system in its own way.

### Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?

I don’t believe that the aircraft would be considered a complex adaptive system as it goes from point a to point b without having to adapt very much to anything. I believe it could be considered a complex adaptive system when weather is bad or if there is an emergency and the aircraft has to adapt to various circumstances.

# Week 2-Module 2: Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems: Many Model Thinking

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about why we model and how value is found within different models and their ability to reveal different conditions for results. I learnt the four main reasons why models about the world are created; they allow us to be an intelligent citizen of the world, they can help us think clearer, to use and understand data effectively as well as being able to decide, strategise and design.  

I also learnt that putting one model to many uses is very insightful and can improve on ‘The Wisdom of the Crowd’. 
 
### What do I ‘know now’ that I did not before? What insights have I gained?

I now know how to find the uses of models and how to provide value through the use of models with the use of REDCAPE; Reason, Explain, Design, Communicate, Act, Predict and Explore. Furthermore, I now know about the wisdom hierarchy to guide our understanding of information that can be gathered from models. 

I have gained insights into how many models used in a particular situation is considered to be good as a different perspective can be taken into consideration just as a jury has different perspectives on the world but together they come to agree to a singular decision. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed over this module is how the ‘one to many’ approach is valuable to have the most effective model in place. By taking a model out of their initial intended purpose and applying it into another discipline can produce notable results.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges I encountered over this module include understanding the concepts that are being described, I also struggled with keeping an open mind with using a model across different disciplines to produce notable results.
 
### What would I do better next time with what anticipated results?

I intend on approaching the content of the next module with an open mind and put more effort and own research into understanding the content being presented as well as the concepts being portrayed.

# Week 3-Module 3: A Supermarket of Models 

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about Modelling People and the 3 types of models used in order to model people. These types of models are; Rational models, Behavioural models as well as Rule-based models. I also learnt about decision-making models how we model this for normative reasons or positive reasons in order to predict why people make the decisions that they do. Alongside this, I learned about signalling models and how people send signals to reveal information or their type. This can be translated into someone who is wealthy purchasing a really expensive artwork. Furthermore, I learned about models that quantify the value and power of individuals and the use of both the last-on-the-bus value as well as the Shapley value and how they are used to produce the results of the model.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before? What insights have I gained?

I have gained insight into the Shapley Value which is able to calculate one’s marginal contribution when they are added to a coalition averaged across all possible orderings in which the coalition of everyone forms. This, in essence, is just imagining the addition of a player to the coalition sequence and calculating each player’s added value for each sequence. The use of the Shapley value provides insight into the following conditions; efficiency, fairness and additivity. Overall the Shapley value is a measure of an individual’s added value. 

I also have gained insights into how models can be geared to model an individual objective such as predicting the stock market, predicting human behaviour, predicting statistics in business etc in order to help achieve the desired outcome.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have observed that through the use of multiple types of models a more efficient result can be apprehended when modelling people by combining results from rational models, behavioural models as well as rule-based models. Although the results from each will be slightly different they all provide significant value as they can be taken into account to produce a singular result to be able to model people effectively.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I don’t believe I encountered any significant challenges this week.

### What would I do better next time with what anticipated results?

I believe I could enhance my understanding of the concepts presented this week and use that knowledge to gain confidence when learning about upcoming modules.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Shapley Value proved to be useful due to how it is used to calculate an individual’s value contribution to a set coalition. This is very insightful as a prediction can be made as to how positively or negatively an individual might affect a coalition if they were to be added into it. I have learnt how to measure the value of adding an individual into a coalition and whether it may be worth it or not based on the result gained from the use of the Shapley Value.

# Week 4: Representing human-centred complex systems

### What have I learnt this week?

During this week I learned about the concept of system dynamics models in comparison to agent-based models. By learning this I have been able to understand how these models are applied in real life scenarios more specifically with predicting the outcome of COVID-19.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know more about the idea of feedback and loops throughout the diagrams which can help enhance my understanding of a system. By referring to diagrams I am able to visualise the system and able to explain and comprehend better the processes of the system. It is also useful as it allows me to see what the expected outcome of the system is and how to get there.

### What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights about how system dynamics models to model COVID-19 are ineffective when compared to agent based models. Agent based models are more effective to model real life scenarios as it can simulate a real world predicament with the use of various autonommous agents. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I believe my perceived strengths would be how I have been able to continously take in new information and comprehend it to the best of my ability. I have perceived understanding through the use of visual diagrams to be a strength as it makes it easier to understand outcomes. A weakness would be how my understanding of the more technical side is still lacking due to the lack of experience I have in the field.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I believe the challenges I have encountered this week would be my lack of understanding in the more technical aspect of the content. I believe this will alleviate as my understanding of programming and modelling expands.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I believe I could take more detailed notes as well as manage my time better. This would allow for new content to be cemented in my mind and allow for me to not rush through content.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I believe the idea of agent based modelling has proved to be the most useful as it seems to be the most necessary model to simulate real world scenarios as it is based on agents that interact in a similar manner that the real world operates. This allows for an almost perfect model of the real world.

# Week 5: Aggregating decisions and behaviour

### What have I learnt this week?

Within module 5 I have learnt about how the notion of predicting patterns and trends within systems. I have learnt how by using patterns and trends, we are able to predict potentially detrimental outcomes through the use of modelling and as a result are able to effectively prepare and potentially find ways to prevent these outcomes.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know more about power laws as well as about long tailed distributions which can be used to track objects that are arriving back to back. This allows for analysis to take place and hence leading to effective predictions about outcomes and the probability of particular events occuring. 

### What insights have I gained?

I believe the most insightful aspect of this weeks module would be in regard to the TED Talk by Geoff West in regard to the use of power laws to discover the lifetimes of cities. As a result of watching this video I have come to the conclusion that diversification is what allows for cities and communities to thrive, whilst on the other hand a lack of diversity is what allows/contributes to communities (companies) to collapse.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

This week my strengths would be my ability to lead and bring together my group to allow for us to begin work on our assessment and finalise our formation. A weakness in regard to this would be actively getting group members to get work done which will hopefully improve in the coming weeks. 

I also found that this week I found understanding the content at hand to be a lot easier and comprehendible.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Getting communication going amongst my teammates has been difficult this week, with no urgency to get any work done from everyone including myself. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I believe I should do better next time with the communication aspect of things, encouraging group members to talk about their ideas more consistently and to possibly liven up the group chat to get some consistent conversation going about our work. I anticipate this will allow for us to finish our assessment quicker and with less stress.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I believe the most useful theory from this module proved to be the aggregation of behaviours. This is due to the fact that by utilising this theory we are able to predict the outcomes of agents if they were to stick to their current behaviours or if they were to adapt and change. As a result a more reliable simulation can be made.

# Week 6: How complex systems evolve in time

### What have I learnt this week? 

During this week I learnt about Markov models and how they are used to measure the evolution of a system over a period of time. I also learnt about how the random walk models and how useful they are in business scenarios such as simulating the stock market.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know about the Granovetter Theory that declares that every individual has a threshold that when crossed will perform a certain action. Individuals with lower thresholds are more likely to riot whereas individuals with higher thresholds are less likely to riot unless there is a larger number of people rioting which lowers the barrier to entry. This notion can be applied to buyers deciding the potential thresholds of customers.

### What insights have I gained?

During this weeks module I have gained insight into how multiple models can be applied to one problem which backs the idea of many model thinking. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My perceived strengths over this week has been getting on top of content in this subject to ensure I am as successful as I can be. A weakness I have observed is a lack of work done to move on with the assessment task both within myself and my groups.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges encountered this week include how my group and I haven't come up with any sort of ideas for our assessment thus far. This will hopefully be changing by next week.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would set a due date or benchmarks for group members to do work as well as for myself as it creates a sense of urgency for us to get started with the necessary work. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The theory that proved to be most useful to me would be the Granovetter Theory. I believe this theory is most useful because it is basically a simulation of real life as for example: the more that are dancing on a dance floor, the more comfortable everyone else becomes and joins in, hence proving the Granovetter Theory with increased numbers lowering the barrier to entry.

# Week 7: Complexity and emergent behaviour (Part 1)

### What have I learnt this week?

During this module I have gained greater insight into the Granovetter's model as well as the standing ovation model. During the lecture I learnt about how agents interact with each other and how the behaviours are altered as a result of the behaviour of neighbouring agents that are in the simulation.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know more about  models such as the schelling's segregation model which relates to agent based models. I now know about how this model is significant due to how it describes segregation based on factors of agents and their behaviours.

### What insights have I gained?

Insights gained this week include how the segregation and riot models can all be applied to basically all situations where a decision must be made by an individual, this can be applied in all aspects of life both within this subject as well as in life in general such as for eg the stock market. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I believe my strengths this week has been my willingness to do the assignment when majority of my group has been very unresponsive. I have taken intitiative and declared myself group leader as well as select the final topic for my group to work on in the assignment. Weaknesses this week would be how ineffective this week has been to bring my group together.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges observed this week include getting some sort of progress done with the assignment. This has been handled by having a group call with every group member as well as delegating work evenly amongst all group members so that everyone can work at their own pace and get all the work done on time.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would reduce the reliance my group has on me chasing them up for work next time and would anticipate that everyone will get the work done on time for any future progress to do with the assignment.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The content which I believe proved most useful would be the application of Schelling's model and how to model it myself. Through the use of an application called NetLogo, I believe this model will be very useful for the assignment as I am able to use the code to guide me through the modelling process for the assignment.

# Week 8: Complexity and emergent behaviour (Part 2)

### What have I learnt this week?

During this week I learnt about the GitHub push/pull feature and learnt how to link it to my JupyterLab so that I can push and pull commits really easily and quickly. Initially this was difficult to do with the installation of multiple plug ins that didn't work for me initially, but with persistence I was able to do so. I also learnt about the Colonel Blotto game as well as the prisoner's dilemma which combine economic decision making with individual psychological processes to make decisions.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know about the various strategies which can be applied to provide the most acceptable game outcomes for individuals involved. This is most prominent in the tit-for-tat strategy within the prisoner's dilemma theory, which encourages cooperation between agents involved, using a punishing but forgiving method. 

### What insights have I gained?

Insights gained this week would be the prisoner's dilemma theory's rule, in regard to establishing this theory's process based on agents and how each decision will receive a different result that decides to either colaborate or defect. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My perceived strengths this week has been my willingness to get all my work done for the assignment as well as being able to understand the content being mentioned. Weaknesses observed this week would be not being able to bring my group together effectively enough to get the assignment done.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges encountered this week mainly consisted of completing the work on time and allowing for my team to put all the work together. I believe there was a lot of miscommunication within my team as well as not being able to set up the Jupyter Lab properly which forced us to submit the assignment as a PDF document.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time I will ensure I have the Jupyter Lab ready and formatted correctly so that my team doesn't have an excuse to not have their work put into the notebook progressively to reduce demand on myself to stop copying and pasting their work. I anticipate this will allow for my team to add in pieces of work consistently with less stress.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The theory which proved to be most useful would be the Colonel Blotto game as it can be applied to anyone to encourage them to be successful as it helps to recognise an individual doesn't need to be the most skilled in order to succeed at something.

# Week 9

### What have I learnt this week?

During this week the workshop was structured differently as it didn't really show any new content. This week we mainly focused on giving feedback in the form of GitHub issues as well as resolving any feedback received

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I didn't know how I was going to implement the code into my JupyterLab up until this week with sir showing us how to add in the code rather than a markdown box.

### What insights have I gained?

Insights gained this week include how I have realised that in order to be successful in this assignment I must have a decent understanding of python and the implementation of python code in order to get my models up and running.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My perceived strengths this week has been my persistence to keep trying even when technology hasn't been on my side this week or in previous weeks in order to get the work done. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges encountered this week would be my group and I's understanding of what's expected in the next section of the assignment and how we would rectify our worries. We handled this by asking Juan for help which allowed for us to understand how to layout the rest of the assignment.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would search medium.com for help or use stack in order to help me get by the programming parts of the assignment. If I struggle with either of these options my next option would be to contact Juan for help. This would allow for my learning to take place and if I am unable to resolve problems on my own, Juan will be able to point me in the right direction as he has throughout the semester.
