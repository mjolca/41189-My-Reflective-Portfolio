# Week 1-Module 1: Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in the Social World

### Describe in your own words what you've learnt.

Within this module I learned about the notion of systems, complex systems and complex adaptive systems as well as the differences between all of them. I learned about how a system is created when vital relationships are made between the system elements as well as parts. As a result of these relationships a system is able to display characteristics and behaviours.

### Why is it important to learn? How does it connect to what you already know? Was it difficult? Why/why not?

I believe that it is important to learn this as it sets a solid foundation for my knowledge to grow and progress throughout this subject. This connects to what I already know so far nicely as I am able to further my knowledge on how information systems work but through a real life analogy of how systems are involved throughout our day to day life. This module was moderately difficult to learn because of all the content but with perseverance I am confident that I’ll be able to understand this.

### What are some examples of this in action? How can you put your learning into practice?

I believe that I can put my learning into practice by visualising the various types of systems that are involved in day to day life which I will be able to further my understanding of. By doing so I will be more confident with learning the content within this subject and will be able to better visualise various systems before putting them into practice.

### To help you recap on some of the key ideas of this module, consider the following questions.  Include your thoughts in your reflective portfolio:
 
### Is everything a system?  Why or why not?

I believe that everything is part of a system to an extent as everything in the world around us has some sort of relationship that exhibits characteristics that are not found in single elements alone.

### As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?

A passenger aircraft is part of a complex system of airports. I believe that the aircraft would be the relationship between various airports but can also be considered its own complex system in its own way.

### Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?

I don’t believe that the aircraft would be considered a complex adaptive system as it goes from point a to point b without having to adapt very much to anything. I believe it could be considered a complex adaptive system when weather is bad or if there is an emergency and the aircraft has to adapt to various circumstances.
