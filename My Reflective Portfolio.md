# Week 1-Module 1: Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in the Social World

### Describe in your own words what you've learnt.

Within this module I learned about the notion of systems, complex systems and complex adaptive systems as well as the differences between all of them. I learned about how a system is created when vital relationships are made between the system elements as well as parts. As a result of these relationships a system is able to display characteristics and behaviours.

### Why is it important to learn? How does it connect to what you already know? Was it difficult? Why/why not?

I believe that it is important to learn this as it sets a solid foundation for my knowledge to grow and progress throughout this subject. This connects to what I already know so far nicely as I am able to further my knowledge on how information systems work but through a real life analogy of how systems are involved throughout our day to day life. This module was moderately difficult to learn because of all the content but with perseverance I am confident that I’ll be able to understand this.

### What are some examples of this in action? How can you put your learning into practice?

I believe that I can put my learning into practice by visualising the various types of systems that are involved in day to day life which I will be able to further my understanding of. By doing so I will be more confident with learning the content within this subject and will be able to better visualise various systems before putting them into practice.

### To help you recap on some of the key ideas of this module, consider the following questions.  Include your thoughts in your reflective portfolio:
 
### Is everything a system?  Why or why not?

I believe that everything is part of a system to an extent as everything in the world around us has some sort of relationship that exhibits characteristics that are not found in single elements alone.

### As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?

A passenger aircraft is part of a complex system of airports. I believe that the aircraft would be the relationship between various airports but can also be considered its own complex system in its own way.

### Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?

I don’t believe that the aircraft would be considered a complex adaptive system as it goes from point a to point b without having to adapt very much to anything. I believe it could be considered a complex adaptive system when weather is bad or if there is an emergency and the aircraft has to adapt to various circumstances.

# Week 2-Module 2 — Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems: Many Model Thinking

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about why we model and how value is found within different models and their ability to reveal different conditions for results. I learnt the four main reasons why models about the world are created; they allow us to be an intelligent citizen of the world, they can help us think clearer, to use and understand data effectively as well as being able to decide, strategise and design.  

I also learnt that putting one model to many uses is very insightful and can improve on ‘The Wisdom of the Crowd’. 
 
### What do I ‘know now’ that I did not before? What insights have I gained?

I now know how to find the uses of models and how to provide value through the use of models with the use of REDCAPE; Reason, Explain, Design, Communicate, Act, Predict and Explore. Furthermore, I now know about the wisdom hierarchy to guide our understanding of information that can be gathered from models. 

I have gained insights into how many models used in a particular situation is considered to be good as a different perspective can be taken into consideration just as a jury has different perspectives on the world but together they come to agree to a singular decision. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed over this module is how the ‘one to many’ approach is valuable to have the most effective model in place. By taking a model out of their initial intended purpose and applying it into another discipline can produce notable results.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges I encountered over this module include understanding the concepts that are being described, I also struggled with keeping an open mind with using a model across different disciplines to produce notable results.
 
### What would I do better next time with what anticipated results?

I intend on approaching the content of the next module with an open mind and put more effort and own research into understanding the content being presented as well as the concepts being portrayed.
